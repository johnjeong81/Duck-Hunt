___What are the controls to your game? How do we play?___

The controls are simple. Click on the left button on the mouse to shoot.
When the duck comes out, aim at the duck with the mouse and click to shoot the duck. 


___What creative additions did you make? How can we find them?___

I added a Main Menu and added a Game Over panel.


___Any assets used that you didn't create yourself? (art, music, etc. Just tell us where you got it, link it here)___

Sprites and Images:

Background Music:

___Did you receive help from anyone outside this class? (list their names and what they helped with)___

Nope.


___Did you get help from any AI Code Assistants? (Tell us which .cs file to look in for the citation and describe what you learned)___

Yes. Most of my codes including DuckController.cs, DuckShooter.cs, and DuckSpawner.cs were written with the help of ChatGPT.
ChatGPT mostly introduced me the functions of the code and the basis, which allowed me to use the basis to implement it to my project.
None of the ChatGPT codes worked initially, but after I changed multiple codes so that it would fit my specific case, it worked.


___Did you get help from any online websites, videos, or tutorials? (link them here)___

Yes. I got a little help from https://github.com/canderson770/Duck-Hunt with overall arts help like backgrounds or animations.

I also watched https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkZfr108m9w&ab_channel=AjeshNair for help but didn't follow their instructions.


___What trouble did you have with this project?___

Overall, it was really difficult to make something on my own, unlike the assignments before. It was a tough job to keep on track
and being motivated enough to follow through the project.


___Is there anything else we should know?___

Nope.
